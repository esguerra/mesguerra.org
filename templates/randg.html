<h1>Using Grace and R to Make Graphs</h1>
<br/>
<p>You will often hear the term "publication-quality" graphs when you
  come to publish your research results. This mainly means, non-excel
  graphs,  which up  to  now are  very  primitive and  non-profesional
  looking. Therefore you  will have to use programs such  as grace, or
  R to  obtain your "publication-quality"  graphs. The praise  for the
  latter program has  even reached the headlines of  the science pages
  of the New York Times news paper.</p>
