Sometimes you need to load trajectory files coming from molecular dynamics simulations
performed in CHARMM. Such files sometimes have the .dcd or the .trj extension.
To open such files in pymol you need to modify the setup.py file and compile your 
pymol version downloaded from the sourceforge subversion repository.

1)
svn co https://pymol.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pymol/trunk/pymol pymol

2)
Make sure that all dependencies are in place.
Most likely there's bound to be many missing and you'll only know from
the warnings and error given at compilation time. Usually some of the
header files which are required are in the development packages, so,
remember to install dependencies with their development packages.
Sometimes, when it's a python dependencie you can check if
it working just by trying to import it in python. e.g.

start python IDE
import Pmw

check for error messages or a clean import.

3)
uncomment lines 135, 136 
uncomment line 156 and ass comma at end
change 0 ot 1 in line 310

4)
python setup.py build install
python setup2.py install
./pymol
