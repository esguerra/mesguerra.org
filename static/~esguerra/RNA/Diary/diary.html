- For solving the numbering of helical regions, try and do some
script which maps the current numbers to some organized numbers, could
also get rid of the interhelical regions by using 3DNA. 
<br/>
- Once you get the global folding relations, then you can go back to
see what happens at a local level. What happens when there is
prescence of non-cannonical base-pairs? Do the helices get bent? If
you "rebuild" helical regions with GU wooble base-pairs what happens?
<br/>

- What do the distances of P atoms to the average helical vector in
helical regions tell us?
<br/>
- How are RNA helices classified? For example, there are A and AII
type RNA helices, are there any other common types?
<br/>
- Can we calculate the persistance lenght for RNA with our models? I
don't mean the static persistance lenght.
<br/>
- What do I mean by a regular helical region? How do I define a
regular helical region? Would it be better to just say a straight
helical region and if so which is the criteria?
<br/>
- How many "regular" helical regions does the ribosome have, and how
many base-pairs are there per helical region?
<br/>
- How are base-pairs distributed in the regular helical regions of the
ribosome? 
<br/>
- What about base and base-pair steps, how are they distributed in
RNAs' regular helical regions?
<br/>
- In the ribosome how is the distribution of interactions between
helical regions and between non-helical and helical regions?

- At today's group meeting Dr. Olson tell me that Andrew's thesis has a
good review of the classification of straight DNA's. This might help a
little on solving my previous question on A, AII, B, BII, etc
classification.

<br/>
- How do helical structure graphs evolve on folding?
<br/>
- The majority of the following questions are solved in Yurong's
thesis, they are, nonetheless still important since they could have a
significantly different answer if the definition of a helical region changes.
<br/>
- - What is the relationship between non-canonical base-pairs
and helical regions? 
<br/>
- - Find the non-canonical and canonical base-pair content of
helices.
<br/>
- - Is the non-canonical content related to the type of RNA? For
example, helical regions in rRNA have a higher non-canonical content
than in tRNA lets say?
<br/>
- - Are all non-canonical base-pairs responsible for tertiary
interactions?
<br/>
- - <b>Q.</b> What about canonical base-pairs? Are they ever responsible for
tertiary interactions? <b>A.</b> Yes they are. If you take a look at
the Watson-Crick isosteric cluster, then you see that 15 of the
base-pairs in the cluster are between helical regions.
<br/>
- - If not, what are the requirements for a non-canonical base-pair
to form a tertiary interaction?
<br/>
- - Dr. Xin's thesis looks at helical regions from a secondary
structure point of view (Section 5.2 of Dr. Xin's thesis). Would this go along
with our final definition of what a helical region is?

- Can a tRNA sequence form a circular RNA?
<br/>
- Is there single stranded circular RNA?

<br/>
-The reference frame for cylindrical RNA helices can just be the
mid step triad between the beggining and the ending base-pairs of the
helical region.

-Visit of Professor's Douglas Turner and Francois Major to Rutgers.
<br/>
<br/>
IDEAS, THOUGHTS:
<br/>
Secondary structures have huge loops. How do you fix that? Maybe the
information on single stranded base-step's can help.

One of the problems while doing my doctorate has been the accumulation
of many ideas. There are so many ideas and projects, that I can't see
them all finished completely. The only thing left to do is to list
them and perhaps some day I can get around to finish all the following
projects:
<br/>
<br/>
- Persistence Lenght of RNA only cannonical. C++ code.
<br/>
- Persistence Lenght of RNA with non-cannonical. C++ code.
<br/>
- Energies of dsRNA's.
<br/>
- RNA tetraloop searches using 3DNA.
<br/>
- Pymol plugin for 3DNA.
<br/>
- RNA Base-Pair-Steps database in django.
<br/>
- Special facts of RNA's database.
<br/>
- Code to convert PDB's of RNA into helical regions
<br/>
- Python code to do weekly fishing of RNA information progress at the PDB.
<br/>
- Code for graph theoretical index calculation based on helical region picture of RNA's.
<br/>

Can graph theoretical descriptors help classify or discover RNA motifs
in X-Ray, or NMR structures?
