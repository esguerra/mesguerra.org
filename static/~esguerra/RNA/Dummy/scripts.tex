\section{Scripts}

\subsection{poshel}

Get the helical parameters in one file, taken out from 3DNA result file.out or file.outs

\subsection{helivec}

Add H and P and rearrange to get nice plot for gnuplot showing vectors. Needs poshel 
to be invoked before


\subsection{makepdbvec}

Trying to make a pdb file out of the file produced from helivec but the visualization
in rasmol is still failing so there most be some problem in the pdb definition. The visualization 
in pymol works better.Needs previous invocation of poshel and helivec.

\subsection{diag.m}

Octave script to get the (i, i+1) components of (H+P)*(H*P)' which are just the dot products of 
the helical axis vectors which tell you about orthonormality. (In a way how the helix
is bent locally)

\subsection{xtract\_hstack}

Script which invokes ex\_str from 3DNA to xtract the structures in the hstacking.pdb file into a
newly created directory.

\subsection{xtract\_rna}

Same as xtract\_hstack but this time it extracts the helical regions from the hel\_regions file into 
separate directories.

\subsection{heliplots}

Plots the graphs of Hx vs Hy, Hy vs Hz and Hz vs Hx, also it plots the dot product of 
Hi dot Hi+1 against the step number including the diagonal to make sure that the vectors
are in fact unitary.
