\part{Structural Scope}

The  new  task is  to  understand RNA  folding.\\  
So  there are  2749 structures in the NDB.\\
816 of these structures have RNA\\
2 Angstrom resolution, only crystal structures.\\
When DNA is taken out of the query the number of structures is reduced
to 101.

279 NMR RNA Strucutres (No res. constraint in query, Y=RNA N=DNA CrysStr=N NMR=Y)

The ways  in which we can hop  in the problem are  by database minning
and electronic structure results.
