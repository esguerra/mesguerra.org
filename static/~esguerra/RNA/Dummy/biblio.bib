  abstract = {One of the most common RNA tertiary interactions involves the docking
	of GNRA hairpin loops into stem-loop structures on other regions
	of RNA. Domain 5 of the group II intron interacts with Domain 1 through
	such an interaction, which has been characterized thermodynamically
	and kinetically for the ai5g intron. Using this system, it was possible
	to test the morphological tolerances of the GNRA tetraloop involved
	in tertiary interactions. The data presented herein show that a GNRA
	tetraloop can still participate in tertiary interaction after being
	physically cut at any phosphodiester linkage within the loop. The
	"nicked tetraloop" can be expanded by many nucleotides in either
	direction and the covalently continuous loop can also be expanded
	without loss of interaction energy. In the context of the nicked
	tetraloop, the second nucleotide of the tetraloop sequence can be
	completely deleted without loss of function. By examining radical
	alterations in tetraloop structure, this study helps define the minimal
	sequence and structural requirements of a GNRA motif involved in
	long-range tertiary interaction. It shows that "tetraloop"-like structures
	capable of forming tertiary interactions can be imbedded in unexpected
	contexts, such as internal loops and apparently open structure within
	RNA. It demonstrates that pentaloops and hexaloops can form the same
	type of interaction, with almost equal affinity, as a tetraloop.
	Taken together, these data suggest a more generic term for the GNRA
	tetraloop-receptor interaction: It is proposed herein that the term
	"GNRA tetraloop" be replaced by "GNn/RA", where n represents a variable
	number of nucleotides and / indicates that the loop can be divided
	and interrupted by other sequences.},

  abstract = {Analyzing nucleic acid structures in a comparable manner has become
	increasingly important as the number of solved structures has increased.
	This paper presents the concepts, mathematics, theorems, and proofs
	that form the basis of a new program to analyze three-dimensional
	DNA and RNA structures. The approach taken here provides numerical
	data in accordance with guidelines set at a 1988 EMBO workshop. Mathematical
	definitions are provided for all local structural parameters described
	in the guidelines. The definitions satisfy the guideline requirements
	while preserving the original physical intuition of the parameters.
	In particular, the rotational parameters are true rotations based
	on a simple physical model (net rotation at constant angular velocity),
	not Euler angles or angles between vectors and planes as is the case
	with other approaches. As a result, the mathematical definitions
	are symmetrical with the property that a 5° tilt is the same as a
	5° roll and a 5° twist, except that the rotations take place about
	different axes. In other approaches, a 5° tilt can mean a different
	amount of net rotation than a 5° roll or a 5° twist. A second unique
	feature of the mathematics is that it explicitly incorporates the
	concept of a pivot point, which is the point about which a base in
	a base-pair rotates as it buckles, propeller twists, and opens. Pivot
	points enable one to model the physical motion of bases more accurately.
	As a result, they greatly reduce and/or eliminate the statistical
	correlations between rotational and translational parameters that
	arise as mathematically induced artifacts in other approaches. This
	paper, together with the statistical analysis in the companion paper
	for determining the locations of the pivot points, provides everything
	needed to understand the output of the program as it relates to individual
	structures.},

	conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects—features usually
	taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from
	the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems1, 2, 3, 4, 5 allow
	us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic
	free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to
	single-molecule force measurements6 and have already provided information

	the Crooks fluctuation theorem9 can be used to determine folding
	free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak
	as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test
	of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers10

  pages = {53-69},
  abstract = {A crucial step in the determination of the three-dimensional native
	structures of RNA is the prediction of their secondary structures,
	which are stable independent of the tertiary fold. Accurate prediction
	of the secondary structure requires context-dependent estimates of
	the interaction parameters. We have exploited the growing database
	of natively folded RNA structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
	to obtain stacking interaction parameters using a knowledge-based
	approach. Remarkably, the calculated values of the resulting statistical
	potentials (SPs) are in excellent agreement with the parameters determined
	using measurements in small oligonucleotides. We validate the SPs
	by predicting 74% of the base-pairs in a dataset of structures using
	the ViennaRNA package. Interestingly, this number is similar to that
	obtained using the measured thermodynamic parameters. We also tested
	the efficacy of the SP in predicting secondary structure by using
	gapless threading, which we advocate as an alternative method for
	rapidly predicting RNA structures. For RNA molecules with less than
	700 nucleotides, about 70% of the native base-pairs are correctly
	predicted. As a further validation of the SPs we calculated Z-scores,
	which measure the relative stability of the native state with respect
	to a manifold of higher free energy states. The computed Z-scores
	agree with estimates made using calorimetric measurements for a few
	RNA molecules. Structural analysis was used to rationalize the success
	and failures of SP and experimentally determined parameters. First,
	from the near perfect linear relationship between the number of native
	base-pairs and sequence length, we show that nearly 46% of nucleotides
	are not in stacks. Second, by analyzing the suboptimal structures
	that are generated in gapless threading we show that the SPs and
	experimentally determined parameters are most successful in predicting
	stacks that end in hairpins. These results show that further improvement
	in secondary structure prediction requires reliable estimates of
	interaction parameters for loops, bulges, and stacks that do not
	end in hairpins.},

	"mode I". They are sufficient to enable DNA to curve gently around
	proteins such as histone octamers in the nucleosome particle. When
	DNA bends around other proteins, such as CAP and TBP, its distortion
	is much more severe. Although the DNA in close contact with these
	proteins includes the CA/TG and TA/TA steps, respectively, the mode
	I flexibility is not deployed: instead, a more severe "mode II" manoeuvre
	is observed in DNA/protein co-crystals. Mode II has several distinctive
	physical features. First, its range of Roll angle is much wider than
	for mode I. Second, the major-groove width remains more-or-less constant
	as Roll increases, whereas it decreases significantly as Roll increases
	in mode I; and this enables the major groove of the DNA to accommodate
	a protein moiety in its severely bent conformation. Third, the value
	of Slide remains more-or-less constant as Roll increases, whereas
	it decreases in mode I. In general, in both modes I and II, the major-groove
	width appears to be closely related to the Slide between base-pairs.
	In mode II there appears to be a definite "point pivot" on the major-groove
	side of the two base-pairs that constitute a dinucleotide step, formed
	either by the steric interlocking of propeller-twisted base-pairs
	or by a bifurcated hydrogen bond. Distortion of DNA in mode II seems
	to be an intrinsic property of the double-helical structure, since
	it occurs whether protein is bound on the major-groove side (e.g.
	CAP) or on the minor-groove side (e.g. TBP). Mode II distortion occurs
	in a wider range of steps than those that show the largest mode-I
	variation; nevertheless, "access" to mode II deformation appears
	to be gained via mode I distortion at particular steps CA/TG and
	TA/TA.},

	such as recombination and transcription. All-atom potential energy
	studies of regular poly(dG)·poly(dC) and poly(dA)·poly(dT) double
	helices, stretched from compressed states of 2.0 Å per base-pair
	step to highly extended forms of 7.0 Å per residue, uncover four
	different hyperfamilies of right-handed structures that differ in
	mutual base-pair orientation and sugar-phosphate backbone conformation.
	The optimized structures embrace all currently known right-handed
	forms of double-helical DNA identified in single crystals as well
	as non-canonical forms, such as the original "Watson-Crick" duplex
	with trans conformations about the P—O5′ and C5′—C4′ backbone bonds.
	The lowest energy minima correspond to canonical A and B-form duplexes.
	
	
	The calculations further reveal a number of unusual helical conformations
	that are energetically disfavored under equilibrium conditions but
	become favored when DNA is highly stretched or compressed. The variation
	of potential energy versus stretching provides a detailed picture
	of dramatic conformational changes that accompany the transitions
	between various families of double-helical forms. In particular,
	the interchanges between extended canonical and non-canonical states
	are reminiscent of the cooperative transitions identified by direct
	stretching experiments. The large-scale, concerted changes in base-pair
	inclination, brought about by changes in backbone and glycosyl torsion
	angles, could easily give rise to the observed sharp increase in
	force required to stretch single DNA molecules more than 1.6–1.65
	times their canonical extension.
	
	
	Our extended duplexes also help to tie together a number of previously
	known structural features of the RecA-DNA complex and offer a self-consistent
	stereochemical model for the single-stranded/duplex DNA recognition
	brought in register by recombination proteins. The compression of
	model duplexes, by contrast, yields non-canonical structures resembling
	the deformed steps in crystal complexes of DNA with the TATA-box
	binding protein (TBP). The crystalline TBP-bound DNA steps follow
	the calculated compression-elongation pattern of an unusual "vertical"
	duplex with base planes highly inclined with respect to the helical
	axis, exposed into the minor groove, and accordingly accessible for
	recognition.
	
	
	Significantly, the double helix can be stretched by a factor of two
	and compressed roughly in half before its computed internal energy
	rises sharply. The energy profiles show that DNA extension-compression
	is related not only to the variation of base-pair Rise but also to
	concerted changes of Twist, Roll, and Slide. We suggest that the
	high energy "activated" forms calculated here are critical for DNA
	processing, e.g. nucleo-protein recognition, DNA/RNA synthesis, and
	strand exchange.},

	features in individual structures. In order to resolve these issues,

	structures of nucleic acid analogs stored in the Cambridge Structural
	Database (CSD). [3] The coordinate frames are chosen so that complementary

	crystal structures of oligonucleotides, the backbone shows one major
	degree of freedom, consisting of the torsion angles , , and the pseudorotation
	phase angle, P. The remaining torsion angles (, , and ) comprise
	two less important degrees of freedom. The base stacking interactions
	show three degrees of freedom: slide-roll-twist, shift-tilt, and
	rise (which is more or less constant). Coupling is observed between
	the base and backbone degrees of freedom. The major base stacking
	mode, slide-roll-twist, is coupled to the major backbone mode, -P--.
	The secondary base stacking mode, shift-tilt, is coupled to and and
	to a lesser extent to the -P-- mode. We show that the length of the
	backbone, C, given by the same strand C1?-C1? separation, is an excellent
	single parameter descriptor for the conformation of the backbone
	and the way in which it is coupled to the base stacking geometry.
	The slide-roll-twist motion relates to changes in the mean backbone
	length, , and the shift-tilt motion to the difference between the
	lengths of the two backbone strands, ?C. We use this observation
	to develop a simple virtual bond model which describes the coupling
	of the backbone conformations and the base stacking geometry. A semi-flexible
	bond is used to connect the same strand C1?-C1? atoms. Analysis of
	the X-ray crystal structure database, simple geometric considerations
	and model building experiments all show that this bond is flexible
	with respect to slide, shift and propeller but rigid with respect
	to the other 14 local base stacking parameters. Using this simple
	model for the backbone in conjunction with potential energy calculations
	of the base stacking interactions, we show that it is possible to
	predict accurately the values of these 14 base step parameters, given
	values of slide, shift and propeller. We also show that the base
	step parameters fall into three distinct groups: roll, tilt and rise
	are determined solely by the base stacking interactions and are independent
	of the backbone; twist is insensitive to the base stacking interactions
	and is determined solely by the constraints of a relatively rigid
	fixed length backbone; slide and shift are the primary degrees of
	freedom and cannot be predicted accurately at the dinucleotide level
	because they are influenced by the conformations of neighbouring
	steps in a sequence. We have found that the context effect on slide
	is mediated by the torsion angles while the context effect on shift
	results from a BI to BII transition in the backbone. We have therefore
	reduced the dimensionality of the dinucleotide step problem to two
	parameters, slide and shift.},

	restorative, and scattershot in eukaryotic lineages1. In contrast,
	genetic recoding by adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing seems common
	in animals; usually, altering highly conserved or invariant coding
	positions in proteins2 4. Here I report striking variation between
	species in the recoding of synaptotagmin I (sytI). Fruitflies, mosquitoes
	and butterflies possess shared and species-specific sytI editing
	sites, all within a single exon. Honeybees, beetles and roaches do
	not edit sytI. The editing machinery is usually directed to modify
	particular adenosines by information stored in intron-mediated RNA
	structures5 7. Combining comparative genomics of 34 species with
	mutational analysis reveals that complex, multi-domain, pre-mRNA
	structures solely determine species-appropriate RNA editing. One
	of these is a previously unreported long-range pseudoknot. I show
	that small changes to intronic sequences, far removed from an editing
	site, can transfer the species specificity of editing between RNA
	substrates. Taken together, these data support a phylogeny of sytI
	gene editing spanning more than 250 million years of hexapod evolution.
	The results also provide models for the genesis of RNA editing sites

	that proteins nucleate the folding of the head, platform, and body

	domains relative to one another. We also examined the contributions
	of individual proteins to the formation of binding sites for sequential
	proteins in the assembly process. Binding sites for the primary binding
	proteins are generally more ordered in the naked RNA than those for
	other proteins. Furthermore, we examined one pathway in the assembly

	organize the RNA around the binding sites of proteins that bind later.
	It appears that the order of assembly depends on the degree of pre-organization

	set of molecular examples, with primary focus on group I introns
	and RNase P RNA. To broaden the scope of RNA folding models and to
	better understand group II intron function, we have examined the
	tertiary folding of a ribozyme (D135) that is derived from the self-splicing
	ai5 intron from yeast mitochondria. The D135 ribozyme folds homogeneously
	and cooperatively into a compact, well-defined tertiary structure
	that includes all regions critical for active-site organization and
	substrate recognition. When D135 was treated with increasing concentrations
	of Mg2+ and then subjected to hydroxyl radical footprinting, similar
	Mg2+ dependencies were seen for internalization of all regions of
	the molecule, suggesting a highly cooperative folding behavior. In
	this work, we show that global folding and compaction of the molecule
	have the same magnesium dependence as the local folding previously
	observed. Furthermore, urea denaturation studies indicate highly
	cooperative unfolding of the ribozyme that is governed by thermodynamic
	parameters similar to those for forward folding. In fact, D135 folds
	homogeneously and cooperatively from the unfolded state to its native,
	active structure, thereby demonstrating functional reversibility
	in RNA folding. Taken together, the data are consistent with two-state
	folding of the D135 ribozyme, which is surprising given the size
	and multi-domain structure of the RNA. The findings establish that
	the accumulation of stable intermediates prior to formation of the
	native state is not a universal feature of RNA folding and that there
	is an alternative paradigm in which the folding landscape is relatively
	smooth, lacking rugged features that obstruct folding to the native

	which allows us to extract the elusive prefactor for RNA folding.
	Several folding scenarios can be anticipated by considering variations
	in the energy landscape that depend on sequence, native topology,

  abstract = {We describe the crystal structure of the complete Thermus thermophilus
	70S ribosome containing bound messenger RNA and transfer RNAs (tRNAs)
	at 5.5 angstrom resolution. All of the 16S, 23S, and 5S ribosomal
	RNA (rRNA) chains, the A-, P-, and E-site tRNAs, and most of the
	ribosomal proteins can be fitted to the electron density map. The
	core of the interface between the 30S small subunit and the 50S large
	subunit, where the tRNA substrates are bound, is dominated by RNA,
	with proteins located mainly at the periphery, consistent with ribosomal
	function being based on rRNA. In each of the three tRNA binding sites,
	the ribosome contacts all of the major elements of tRNA, providing
	an explanation for the conservation of tRNA structure. The tRNAs
	are closely juxtaposed with the intersubunit bridges, in a way that
	suggests coupling of the 20 to 50 angstrom movements associated with
	tRNA translocation with intersubunit movement.},

  abstract = {The abbreviated name, 'mfold web server', describes a number of closely
	related software applications available on the World Wide Web (WWW)
	for the prediction of the secondary structure of single stranded
	nucleic acids. The objective of this web server is to provide easy
	access to RNA and DNA folding and hybridization software to the scientific
	community at large. By making use of universally available web GUIs
	(Graphical User Interfaces), the server circumvents the problem of
	portability of this software. Detailed output, in the form of structure
	plots with or without reliability information, single strand frequency
	plots and 'energy dot plots', are available for the folding of single
	sequences. A variety of 'bulk' servers give less information, but
	in a shorter time and for up to hundreds of sequences at once. The
	portal for the mfold web server is http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold.
	This URL will be referred to as 'MFOLDROOT'.},
