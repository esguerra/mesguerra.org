<b>What is persistence lenght?
<br>
Why is this concept useful and how is it interpreted.</b>
<br>
Persistance length is the average of the scalar projections of all bond
vectors in a polymeric chain, in a reference bond i, (Migth be
thougth as a middle bond?) except the head and tail vectors.(Is it the component of the projection
vector?)
<br>
There are also types of persistence length, that is:
<br>
<i>Persistance Length for Bending</i>
<br>
This value according to Manning, Biopolymers, <b>27</b>, 1533 is
between 94 bp and 290 bp for DNA depending on ionic strength.
<br>
<br>
<i>Persistence Lenght for Twist</i>
<br>
<i>Persistence Lenght for Contraction/Extension</i>
