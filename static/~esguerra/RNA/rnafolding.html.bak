<b>From Schroeder2002:</b>
<br>
RNA Folding in vitro and in vivo can be comparable in some situation but not in others.
It seems that RNA folding can be facilitated in vivo in ocassions where it does not
occur in vitro as in pre-rRNA expression in e.coli.
in vitro and in vivo scientists (as "opposed to in silico and in cogito") propose two 
models for large RNA molecules folding, that is;
<br>
1) Random Coil forms after transcription, non-directional folding follows (seen in vitro)
<br>
2) Folding occurs during transcription as directed by sequence (proposed for in vivo)
