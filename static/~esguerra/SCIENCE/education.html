Reflections about Tent State and Education
</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<b>April 10, 2007</b>
<br>
One of the fundamental components of education is, naturally, books. Cutting
funds on libraries is just putting another brick in the walls of capital, for
example the library crisis in Oregon. (See link: <a
href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/03/04/MNGC7N6Q3M1.DTL">Libraries
Crisis</a>)
<br>
And this is not the only type of wall that is being built in the US today. Of course the one against the Mexican threat 
is also being built.

Comparison of wealth and investement
<br>
The total aid of the US to Colombia in
2006 was <b>733.8</b> Megadollars, 82% of this aid was military and the remaining 18% went to economic and social assistance 
(<a href="http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/aidtable.htm">CIPonline</a>).
<br>
The budget cut for the 2006/2007 academic year at Rutgers was around <b>66</b> Megadollars.
<br>
The Debt Service Payments that Colombia has to give to the world bank can be seen at: <a

<br>
If one sums the bills to pay from April 1st 2007 until April 15th 2008, one gets <b>488.97</b> Megadollars.
<br>
<!-- Colombia's total External Debt according to the Bank of the Republic (who knows what the real value is) 
is: <b>40,039</b> MegaDollars. -->
