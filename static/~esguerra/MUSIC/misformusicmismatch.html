<h1>M is for Music & Memory</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Alte Musik, or Early Music (~476 - 1600)</h2>
Or music from the european middle ages. 
<br>
<br>
- Hildegard Von Bingen (1098-1179)
<br>
The abbess of Binge, or the sybil of the Rhine. Lived 81 years and left 
one of the most vivid proofs of the nonsense of considering the medieval ages 
a dark era. Perhaps also a proof of the importance of schizofrenia in the 
development of human knowledge.
<br>
<br>
- The Cantigas of Alphonse X, the Wise. (circa 1250)
<br>
<br>
- Codex Faenza (circa 1400)
<br>
Mostly of Italian origin. A collection of keyboard transcriptions.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<h2>Baroque (~1600 - 1750)</h2>
- Claudio Monteverdi
<br>
- Antonio Vivaldi
<br>
- Georg Friederich Haendel
<br>
- Johannes Sebastian Bach


<br>
<hr>
<h2>Classical (~1750 - 1820)</h2>
- Joseph Haydn
<br>
- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
<br>
- Ludwig Van Bethoven
<br>
- Luigi Boccherini (1743 - 1805)
<br>

<h2>Acousmatic Music</h2>
<p>It seems like Pythagoras at some point decided that his students would pay more attention to him
if they were not seeing him but just listened to what he said across a screen.</p>
<p>If "The Knife" uses screens, said action allowing you to hear an image, 
can this be acousmatic?</p>
<p>Please, please, "The Knife", don't ever become unplugged?</p>
<p>Acousmatic music is described by the Wikipedia as a specialised sub-set of electroacoustic music. I 
don't think that the definition needs to be this
restricitive. Maybe it could better be defined as music dettached from
direct visual interaction of the observer with the source.</p>

<h2>Electroacustic Music</h2>
The festival the third ear in Colombia was centered in this kind of music. 
I am not sure if the festival is still running. Hopefully it is.
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Electronic Music (circa 1980 - 2007)</h2>
<a href="http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/">120 years of electronic music</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.phinnweb.org/history/">The history of electronic 
music</a>

<p>For me it started with Depeche Mode's Violator in 1990. The tape had
just been released. Toro was the guy you had to beg to get your
hands on the tape since music distribution was very bad in those days in 
Colombia.</p>

<hr>

<p>I had been away from new music for a while, I guess I'm going back to 
hearing new stuff, and so, here's yet another list for my bad memory of 
bands to pay more attention to.
</p>

- Band of Horses
- Flaming Lips
- TV on the Radio
- Yo la Tengo
