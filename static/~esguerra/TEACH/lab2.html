The inventor of chromatography was a Russian botanist named Mikhail Tswett.
He applied his technique to the separation of two pigments found in plants. These are Chlorophyl a and 
Chlorophyl b. Unfortunately Tswett's work was not duly recognized in his lifetime. You can find more 
information in Wikipedia.
