- Exam II will only cover up to 6.6. Sections 7.1-7.2 will be covered on the third exam.
<br>
<br>
- I suggest looking at the previous semesters exams, you can get the 2002-2003 exams at:
<br>
<a href="http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/Courses_f04/Chem161/oldexams.pdf">OldExams</a>
<br>
and the answers are at:
<br>
<a href="http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/Courses_f04/Chem161/index161.shtml">Answers</a>
<br>
Specially look at exam II and also the pertaining questions in the final exam.

- For example, exercise <b> 46 </b> of the 2002 Exam.
<br>
A 32.0 g sample of CH4 gas in a container exerts a pressure ot 1.00 atm. What mass of CO2 gas must be added to the container in order to increase the total pressure to 1.50 atm? Assume no CH4 escapes.
<br>
<br>
So, for this problem the first thing that you realize is that you must use Dalton's law of partial pressure and therefore you can find the partial pressure of the CO2 gas, that is:
<br>
<br>
Ptotal = PCO2 + PCH4, so, PCO2 = Ptotal - PCH4 = 1.5 - 1.0 = 0.5
<br>
<br>
Now that you have the partial pressure of CO2 what should you do? Find a connection with moles rigth? How? Remember the definition of the molar fraction and its relation to partial pressure? Also, do you have the moles of CH4? You sure do! Then:
<br>
<br>
Partial Pressure of CO2 = Molar fraction of CO2 * Total Pressure
<br>
PCO2 = XCO2 * Ptotal
<br>
0.5 atm / 1.5 atm = moles CO2 / ( moles CO2 + moles CH4)
<br>
 --- moles CH4 = 32 g CH4 * 1 mol CH4 / 16 g CH4 = 2 moles CH4 ---
<br>
1/3 = moles CO2 / ( moles CO2 + 2)
<br>
Solving for moles of CO2 we get:
<br>
1/3 * ( moles CO2 + 2) = moles CO2    ;  2/3 + (1/3 * moles CO2) = moles CO2
<br>
2/3 = moles CO2 - ( 1/3 moles CO2) = moles CO2 (1 - 1/3)
<br>
<br>
So the answer is just one mole of CO2 and one mol of CO2 weighs 12 + (2 * 16) = 44 grams of CO2.
<br>

b. Because you are given the specific heat capacity then you know
the amount of energy per degree centigrade and per gram in units of
Joules, therefore you just need to convert the moles of Ag to grams, that
is, 24.31 g Ag / 1 mol Ag and multiply it.
<br>
c. Remember that Delta H = S * m * Delta T, you have Delta H, S and Delta
T, then you can calculate m, remember to change units of kJ to J.

<hr>                                                                                                                       
6.42)
For this one you just have to apply energy balance, that is, the
Heat lost by the pellets, must be the same as the heat gained by the
water, so:
<br>
Delta H for hot pellets = Delta H that water gained from pellets
<br>
S of Al * m of Al * (100 - Tfinal) + S of Fe * m of Fe * (100 - Tfinal) =
S of water * m of water * (T final - 22)

<hr>                                                                                                                       
6.46)
Very similar to 6.42, just remember that the heat lost by the water is the
same heat gained to dissolve:
<br>
Heat needed to dissolve = Heat given away by water
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp 
&nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp  = 4.18 * (1.6 + 75.0) * (25.0 - 
23.34)
<br>
Now, remember that this gives you an answer in Joules per gram, so, first
you have to find the energy for 1.60g and then convert it to moles.

<hr>
6.48)
For this one the first thing that you must determine is which of the two
reactants is the limiting one. Once you do that remember that you are
given the Delta H for the reaction, that is, you have -118kJ / 1 mol
Ba(OH)2 or -118kJ / 2 mol HCl, so you can get the heat from this, now it
must be easy to get from our expression:
<br>
Delta H = S * m * Delta T
<br>
The final temperature since we have Delta H, S and m and the initial
temperature.
    
<br>
