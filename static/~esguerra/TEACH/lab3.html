You might have noticed that it was difficult to tell in the prelab if the 
compounds, PbCrO4 and AlCrO4 would be soluble when looking at your 
solubilities table in page 24 of your lab manual. This was due to not 
having a specific solubility rule for CrO4-. When such a case occurs you 
can always check the Merck Index to see if the compound is soluble or not. 
Go to the resources section to find the link to The Merck Index.
