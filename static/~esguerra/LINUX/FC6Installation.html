<h1>Fedora Core 8 Installation Details</h1>

<p>In order to make my laptop compatible with C++ and fortran for class
and also to be able to use my molecular modeling softwares I've had to
do the following post-installation customizations. </p>
<ol>
<li>Install icewm. I installed icewm because it doesn't take forever on
opening terminals like kde or gnome do.
<pre>
bash$ sudo yum install icewm
</pre>
</li>
<li>Install various software lacking in the standard Fedora Core 6
installation. I used yum to make the majority of this updates, the
biggest problem was finding the name of the correct software to be
able to tell yum to install it. I did this mainly by using:
<br>
#yum search pdflatex | less
<br>
And then from the results I was sometimes able to tell that tetex does
not include latex, and therefore no pdflatex.
This are some of the yum updates that I've done.
<pre>
bash$ yum install gcc
bash$ yum install compat-gcc-34-g77
bash$ yum install tetex
bash$ yum install tetex-latex
bash$ yum install xpdf
bash$ yum groupinstall XFCE
bash$ yum install scipy
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
