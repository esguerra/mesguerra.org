<pre>I attempt from Love's sickness to fly in vain,</pre><pre> Since I am myself my own fever and pain.</pre><pre>
				
			</pre><pre> No more now, fond heart, with pride no more swell,</pre><pre> Thou canst not raise forces enough to rebel.</pre><pre> I attempt from Love's sickness to fly in vain,</pre><pre> Since I am myself my own fever and pain.</pre><pre>
				
			</pre><pre> For Love has more power and less mercy than fate,</pre><pre> To make us seek ruin and love those that hate.</pre><pre> I attempt from Love's sickness to fly in vain,</pre><pre> Since I am myself my own fever and pain.</pre>

			<h1>A Sick, Sick Thing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=b7><span
style='font-size:9.0pt'>September 1, 2000 </span></span></h1>
			<p class=c>by Stephany Aulenback </p>
			<p class=MsoNormal><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
			</p>
			<p class=g>The best metaphor for love is that it is a sickness. A sick person
has an excuse for being distracted, for being dazed, and for paying too much
attention to how he or she looks and feels. A sick person, like the newly
love-struck, is excused for being whiny and dramatic and for doing nothing but
lounging around in pajamas. </p>
			<p class=f>Sure, there are lots of prettier clichés about love, like Sir Walter
Scott's 'love is heaven' or Wordsworth's 'love is an unerring light,' but I'm
with Shakespeare on this one: 'My love is as a fever.' This view of love as
illness isn't a cynical one, it's romantic. The Romantics were always dying of
consumption, which they blamed on their feelings of passion. (If you're looking
for a cynical metaphor try Baudelaire, who claimed that love is 'an oasis of
horror in a desert of boredom.') But to compare love to a simple disease is to
oversimplify. Love-sickness is not just Shakespeare's fever or the Romantics'
consumption; it is not one illness, but many. </p>

<p class=f>Sometimes love-sickness is a rash, perhaps like the chicken pox. A
childish, almost foolish illness, it shows all over the victim's face and body.
It makes her want to scratch where it itches. The rash lasts only a few weeks
though, and if scratched, it will leave scars. My cousin had that kind of
love-sickness once; he was driven mad by his rash of a love for his very first
girl-friend, a blonde beauty whose image graced small-town billboards. They
made love feverishly all over the campus of their boarding school. One day,
while scratching their itch on the stage of the school's abandoned auditorium,
they were discovered by a teacher's wife, expelled from the school, and sent
back to distant and different hometowns. Ten years later, when he met her by
accident in a restaurant, he told me their meeting felt like ripping the skin
off a scab. </p>

<p class=f>Love-sickness can be like a migraine headache - a painful sort of
blinding by light, gone in a day or two. I felt that way about a boy I knew for
two days when I was fourteen. We met on a weekend camping trip and passed the
time doing little more than staring at each other. His gaze made my head ache;
my hand felt huge and swollen when he held it the night before we parted. I can
still conjure up his expression, all hazy and golden like the aura migraine
sufferers sometimes see. </p>

<p class=f>Love-sickness can also feel like a broken limb, a pain that keeps
you up at night for months and hinders your progress. During college my
formerly confident and assertive roommate was crippled for more than a year by
a crush on someone she barely knew: a prim looking, reserved boy in her English
class who charmed her when he said he thought the word 'thwart' sounded like a
'knife thrust into wood.' She spent her sleepless nights planning ways to get
his attention - dropping her books at his feet, writing poetry about him and
reciting it in front of the class, inviting him to parties he didn't turn up
for - and yet he never seemed to register her presence in any romantic way. As
the weeks passed she grew withdrawn and quiet, spending her evenings alone at
home, nursing her crippling love until, many months later, she healed. </p>

<p class=f>There are more serious forms of love-sickness, of course. The
love-sickness that leads to marriage is a terminal illness. It takes over your
whole being and eats away at it until it ends in the death of your former life.
If we stretch that metaphor and turn it on its head, then the love-sickness
that leads to marriage is a proof of the afterlife. Some people go to heaven,
others to hell, while most subsist in a kind of purgatory. </p>

<p class=f>Perhaps that is too cynical a view. </p>

<p class=f>Maybe it's more romantic to say that the love that leads to marriage
is a chronic illness, like asthma or diabetes. Many people who have learned to
live with a chronic illness rarely think of themselves as sick. And many people
who have learned to live with marriage rarely think of themselves as in love.
But every so often, in just the way an asthmatic gets breathless or a diabetic
gets dizzy from her blood sugar levels, the symptoms recur. </p>

<p class=f>We don't yet understand what causes love-sickness. Just as we have
endless lists of the possible causes of cancer - faulty genes, perhaps, or
radiation from our microwaves or hormones in the meat supply - we all have our
own beliefs about what causes love-sickness. One is that it is caused by
hormones in the meat supply. There are many others - almost as many as we see
cases of love-sickness. </p>

<p class=f>It's clear that a person who becomes love-sick is infected by
another. A strange feature of the illness is that a person whose love-sickness
is only as mild as a cold, can infect someone with an acute case as dire as
pneumonia. And sometimes, even while the infectious person doesn't display any
symptoms of his own, the afflicted one will point an insistent finger at him,
waiting for evidence that he is love-sick too. Some may argue that
love-sickness is a sexually transmitted disease like syphilis or herpes, but
often a person's love-sickness is caused by not having sex with the person who
infects them. Indeed, love-sickness is sometimes cured by sex. </p>

<p class=f>So what should people do when they become love-sick? They should go
to bed at once, of course, and luxuriate in their symptoms. After all, it is
when you are sick that you are most conscious of your physical existence and of
the impermanence of your mortal state. So it is with love. For when you are
suffering from love-sickness, you become wonderfully aware of how alive you are
- even if it is in an oasis of horror.</p>

<p class=f>Otra vez, de vuelta. Termina siendo un ciclo de la eternidad.</p>


<p>Me tuerce la cabeza, me deja salir, me deja entrar, las dos acciones al mismo tiempo.
<p>Estoy cansado, en los fines de semana los recuerdos me pesan tanto que no me dejan levantarme.
<p>Ya no leo, solo quiero dormir.

<p>Ya no veo, solo quiero dormir.

<p>Ahora si, por fin, tengo tiempo para dedicarme a ser un pervertido, a intentar conseguir relaciones imposibles en un mundo imposible.

<p>Si, llora ninho chiquito, llora como una nena, llora porque fuiste enganhado, porque desde tu crianza te insertaron la farsa del "amor"</p> 

<p>Tambien me pregunto porque tender a este cabron indio a la izquierda que no me deja ser un pervertido inofensivo en paz, si el puede ponerse a jugar juegos estupidos porque no me deja a mi que estoy jugando juegos para mayorcitos.</p> 





<p>Febrero 2 de 2005</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aca comienzo mi terapia</p>


<p>Me pregunto si el piensa en ella todo el dia?</p>
<p>Se que no, se que nadie puede pensar en ella como yo, se que ella no piensa en mi, se que soy invisible para 
ella. </p>

<p>Se me tuerce la vida cuando compartimos espacios y miradas</p>
