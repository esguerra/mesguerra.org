The regular user has no idea that google can be actually interfaced
with in a far richer way than the one of just click and scroll.
Google help pages avoid telling the user the richer language functions
which can be used to make better, more specific google searches.
Perhaps they just want to adopt a Windoze like philosophy of assuming
a "tabula rasa" user. Here are some google search functions.

filetype:  	# restrict to doc, pdf, jpg, etc. 
site:		# restrict to a site, e.g. site:google.com
daterange:	# Unfortunately it depend on julian dates (see links)
		# Supposedly writing 2000..2010 should do it too.
