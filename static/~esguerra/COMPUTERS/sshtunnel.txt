To make a tunnel to a computer authorized in a local network

- Windows

Open cmd
>>cd Program Files\SSH Communications Security\SSH Secure Shell
>>ssh2  -l myuserid  -L 7777:work:22  gate  cat -
The previous command opens the tunner to the gate.
In another cmd terminal write
>>cd Program Files\SSH Communications Security\SSH Secure Shell
>>ssh2 -p 7777 localhost
>>gnome-terminal &

- Linux

ssh  -l myuserid  -L 7777:work:22  gate  cat -
ssh -p 7777 localhost 
sftp -oPort=7777 localhost

OR

ssh -f -l username -L 7777:remotehostname:22 gatehostname -N
ssh -p 7777 localhost


An alternative to ssh tunnel is to use vpn.
For Rutgers you have to login as root to your computer and create a new 
configuration file at /etc/vpnc.

nano rutgers-vpn.conf

IPSec gateway vpn.rutgers.edu
IPSec ID rutgers-ipsec
IPSec secret rutgers
Xauth username myusernamehere

After this you just have to do:

sudo vpnc rutgers-vpnc      # To start vpnc
sudo vpnc-disconnect   # To logoff from vpnc
