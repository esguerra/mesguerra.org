<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>



<p><i>Nature</i> June 2, <b>2005</b> Abstract:</p>

 * Vanishing white matter disease turns the insulation between active brain cells into a yellow, 

gelatin-like fluid. Study of this distressing condition 

has highlighted an aspect of our biology that could change how we treat diabetes, cancer and infertility.

A mysterious disease that causes children's brains to melt away is caused by errors in RNA translation. But biologists are realizing that this 

horrifying condition could shed light on more common problems. Claire Ainsworth reports.

<p> * The 2006 nobel prize in medicine was awarded to Andrew Z. Fire (Stanford) and Craig C. Mello 

(UMass) for their discovery of <a 

href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2006/">RNAi</a>.</p>

<p> * The 2006 nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to the son of

famous biochemist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kornberg">Arthur Kornberg</a>. The prize 
has been granted for his

work on Eukaryotic <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2006/press.html">transcription</a>. </p>



<p> * The proposed 2008 budget for Colciencias (NSF analog) is:

160'000 x 10^6 pesos, that is, 72 x 10^6 dollars.(Note: The exchange rate was 2000 pesos
per dollar)</p>

<p> * The NSF proposed budget for 2008 is 6429 x 10^6

dollars. </p>

<!-- <p> * The Colombian drug (cocaine) dealing cartel, known as, "Las Farc", demands
complete control of an area of 800 square kilometers in Colombia to
"possibly" consider an exchange of murders, thiefs, and drug dealers
for kidnapped hostages (who've paid various ransoms) whom they've had
captive for over five years. Two things come to mind immediately,
comparison of this prisoners to stories of US POW's in Vietnam, and
two, are you kidding me? 800 square Km? More than the whole of
Singapore (693 sq Km - CIA Factbook), almost 3 times as much as the urban area of
Bogota (307.36 sq Km - <a
href="http://www.bogota.gov.co/portel/libreria/php
/frame_detalle.php?h_id=16683">Alcaldia Bogota</a>). What do you want
such a huge area for? Hmmm, let's see 80000 hectares of cocaine
plantations, for..., let's say the rest of Uribe's government, that is, 3
years.<a href="http://www.narconews.com/Issue34/article1028.html">One
hectare produces about eight Kg of coke per year</a>.That's 640000 Kg,
or 640 Tons per year. Finally that amounts to 1920 Tons in 3 years. If
the FARC sells the gram of cocaine for..., let's say, two dollars, then that is
$1280 x 10^6 dollars. Sweet deal!</p> -->

<p> * Not such and interesting fact but if you want to see my old master's proposal submitted to the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (In 
SPANISH) 
you can download it <a href="http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~esguerra/proyectomasterunal.pdf">here</a>. If you are interested in 
Astrochemistry I think it still has a nice short introduction to the field. </p>
